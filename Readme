Quizify: Dynamic AI Quiz Generator App

## Project Overview

This project implements a Dynamic AI Quiz Generator App that uses AI to create custom quizzes on-the-fly based on user-specified topics. The application leverages state-of-the-art language models available through Hugging Face's Inference API to generate questions, answer options, and correct answers in a multiple-choice format.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Question Generation**: Utilizes AI to generate unique quiz questions for each session.
- **Category-Based Quizzes**: Users can select from various programming topics like JavaScript, CSS, HTML, etc.
- **Customizable Difficulty**: Option to adjust the number of questions or potentially the difficulty level (future enhancement).
- **Interactive User Interface**: A responsive web interface for selecting categories, starting quizzes, answering questions, and viewing results.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate feedback on answers with visual indicators for correct/incorrect responses.
- **Loading State**: Visual feedback during question generation to improve user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms for when AI generation fails.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:

- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the UI.
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS for all client-side interactions and DOM manipulation.

### Backend:

- **Node.js**: With Express.js for handling HTTP requests and serving the application.
- **Hugging Face Inference API**: For AI-driven question generation.

### AI Models:

- Currently uses **gpt-neo** from EleutherAI, but can be adapted to use other models available on Hugging Face.

### Libraries:

- **@huggingface/inference** for interacting with the Hugging Face API.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- A Hugging Face account for an API key

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dynamic-ai-quiz-generator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

   ```text
   HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Start the Application**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start, and you can access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

1. **Select Category**: Users choose from predefined categories or input a new one.
2. **Set Quiz Parameters**: Decide the number of questions or other parameters.
3. **Generate Quiz**: Start the quiz generation process.
4. **Answer Questions**: Navigate through questions, selecting answers.
5. **Review Results**: See scores, review answers, and learn from mistakes.

## Development Notes

- **Prompt Engineering**: The quality of generated questions depends greatly on how prompts are crafted. Continuous refinement of these prompts can significantly enhance the app's output.
- **Model Performance**: Experiment with different models or fine-tuning to improve question quality and relevance.
- **User Experience**: Enhance with animations, better error messages, or additional features like question types (true/false, fill-in-the-blank).
- **Security**: Keep API keys secure, use environment variables, and ensure the application is safe against common web vulnerabilities.

## Contribution

Contributions to this project are highly appreciated:

- **Bug Fixes**: Report or fix bugs.
- **Feature Additions**: New categories, quiz types, or UI enhancements.
- **AI Improvements**: Better integration with AI models, prompt optimization, or new model suggestions.
